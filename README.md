# Credit-Card-Approval
Banks receive a lot of applications for issuance of credit cards. Many of them rejected for many reasons, like high-loan balances, low-income levels, or too many inquiries on an individualâ€™s credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is error-prone and a time-consuming process. This task can be automated with the power of machine learning. The project provides the credit card approval predictor using different machine learning algorithm , just like the real banks do.
